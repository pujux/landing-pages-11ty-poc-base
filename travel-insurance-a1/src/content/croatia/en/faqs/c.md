question: Do I have to announce my planned trips in advance?

Travel protection is real-time insurance. You do not have to tell us in advance when, how long or where you are going. The protection applies from the time your mobile phone dials into the foreign network or you return to your home network. 
 
As a result, you don't pay unnecessary premiums if you don't make your trip or travel home earlier than planned. But you also don't risk staying abroad without insurance cover if you unexpectedly stay longer. Your travel insurance allows you full flexibility.
