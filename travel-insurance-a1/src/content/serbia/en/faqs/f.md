question: How is the insurance premium calculated and how do I pay?
---

The insurance premium is calculated on a daily basis, i.e. for each calendar day spent traveling outside of Serbia. If you leave the borders of Serbia on the 1st of the month at 5:00 p.m., and return to Serbia on the 4th of the month at 8:00 a.m., you will be charged 4 premiums. There are two tariffs depending on which countries you are traveling to - EUROPE and WORLD.
You pay the premiums together with the bill for A1 services. Each individual (daily) premium will be displayed on the A1 account.
